# Runner_in_RAGE
## This is a basic game to understand but hard to win
### So the main concept is just to win all levels and it is a game which does not want you to win it

## Movement: LEFT ARROW KEY, RIGHT ARROW KEY, UP ARROW KEY, DOWN ARROW KEY

. We are a cool ball that looks bright but the background is a plain black area for no light making the ball sad

. There are solid blocks for us to walk on and jump on

. There are many spikes everywhere which are meant for RAGE emotion of player because they are placed in hard areas, they reset the level

. Each level has a flag which lets you get to another level

. There are fake flags that work like a spike | The other spikes in high levels make you go to a different level like 1 or 2 or 4

## Becareful because if you stand or wait in a level without dieing for too long, you lose physics and fall off the map, so atleast die if you will wait in the level, BTW no pause button for fun

### I hope you enjoy this game
